ROOT5/FLUKA interface v0 for NA60+ performance studies (E. Scomparin, Feb 2019)
==============================================================================

This interface allows the user to generate a dimuon signal, using the processes defined in the C++ class GenMUONLMR, and to feed them into FLUKA. The output of FLUKA is a text file containing the muon kinematics, to be used for reconstruction. A ROOT file containing some control histograms is also created.
It is tested and working on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and requires a working installation of FLUKA and of ROOT5.

The following files are needed and should be placed in the working directory (except lfuka_root, see below).

FluLib.cpp
----------

Contains the C++ code that performs the choice of the process, books control histograms, invokes GenMUONLMR and trigger the generation of events.

The number of generated events (1000, in this case) is contained in the FLUKA data card

* ..+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7..
START         1000.0                                          1000000.

GenMUONLMR.h, GenMUONLMR.cpp
----------------------------

The class that performs the generation.

source_interface.f
------------------

Calls the C++ function and puts the momenta of the decay muon in the FLUKA stack. In order for the interface to be activated the following FLUKA data card should be set

* ..+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7..
SOURCE           1.         1.
 

usrout.f
--------

Prints the ROOT control histograms.

stuprf.f, mgdraw.f
------------------

Contains instructions related to the definition of the primaries.

magfld.f
--------

Magnetic field information.

lfluka_root
-----------

It is a customized version of the lfluka link macro, it has to be placed in the directory $FLUPRO/flutil.

Makefile
--------

Performs the compilation and linking of all the files. It is suggested to perform a "make clean" before issuing the command "make".

rfluka.sh
---------

Runs FLUKA.
